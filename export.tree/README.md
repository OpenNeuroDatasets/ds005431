# 1. Sample Preparation

- Brain tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA).
- Before MRI scanning, samples were immersed in a 0.2 mM gadolinium-containing 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS PH: 7.4) for at least one week.
- During MRI measurements, samples were immersed in Fluorinert (Sumitomo 3M Limited, Tokyo, Japan) to minimize background signal.

# 2. MRI Scanners and Coil Selection
## a. For Small to Medium-sized Brains
- Scanner: 7T MRI scanner (BioSpec 70/16, Bruker Biospin GmbH, Ettlingen, Germany)
- Gradient System: Actively shielded gradients with a maximum strength of 700 mT/m
- Coils:
  - Volume coils: φ 22 mm, 38 mm, 62 mm, and 72 mm (Bruker Biospin GmbH, Ettlingen, Germany)
  - Solenoid coils: φ 16 mm and 30 mm (Takashima Seisakusho, Tokyo, Japan)
Coil selection was based on sample size.

## b. For Large Brains (e.g., bamboo mouse)
- Scanner: 3T Philips MRI scanner (Ingenia, Philips, Netherlands)
- Coil: 32-channel head coil
